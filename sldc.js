// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "Next the developers will decide on what will be used to help make sure they are helping the business rules, and data structures to use. This will help the developers understand how long it will take them to make the code."

const design = "Designing the software through psudo-code so the developers have a good idea of what the code should look like."

const implementation = "create the code so it meets the requirments of the client."

const testingAndIntegration = " Test the software and have it tested by QA to see if there are any bugs. If there is none then it will go live."

const maintain = "Update the code with any fixes to bugs and updates for the users."
